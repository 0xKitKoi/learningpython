FIX THESE:
	
#fixed	- the path to the gifs are hardcoded
#fixed		assumes the username is loxxie because they are hardcoded

#fixed	- no exe file
#fixed		hard to launch and spams the terminal
			Removed un-needed print statements, no more spam
			made two scripts to run main.py without a window open.


#fixed?	- Requires the user to have tkinter and pyautogui installed
#fixed?		user has to run pip install on dependancies
#fixed?		program should do it for them.
			It would seem that python preinstalls tkinter.
				pyautogui is not needed.

		Make it better kitkoi
